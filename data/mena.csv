dictators was deposed by the army yesterday, prompting wild celebrations among crowds who had demanded an end to president bashir s genocidal regime. the demonstrators joy quickly turned to anger, however, when mr bashir s once loyal defence minister announced that a military council was taking over for an interim period of two years and a state of emergency was being imposed. sudan s airspace and borders were closed and its constitution suspended, lieutenant general awad mohammed ibn auf, 65, announced on state tv. he had been regarded as one of the president s staunchest allies and will now head the military council. kamal abdel marouf al mahi, the sudanese military s chief of staff, will be its deputy head. the toppling of mr bashir, 75, known as the butcher of darfur after atrocities in the western region, came after months of protests that culminated in a sit in by thousands of people outside the army headquarters in the capital, khartoum. yesterday they vowed to defy the imposition of a night curfew and continue their action until a civilian body controlled the transition. the risk of instability is significant, with various factions within the security apparatus potentially siding with the demonstrators or staying loyal to mr bashir, who ruled for 30 years. the deposed leader had deliberately set up labyrinthine parallel structures to prevent the military taking control. last night columns of demonstrators filled khartoum s roads and bridges over the nile as they marched towards the protest camp where they were determined to spend a sixth night. more demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country, including in the eastern city of atbara, where the first protest was held four months ago. fall, again! many chanted in khartoum, varying the anti bashir fall, that s all! refrain that marked the uprising s initial demands. awad abdel bayen, a leading opposition figure, described the takeover as giving new life to bashir rule . the sudanese professionals association, the biggest protest group, announced that the revolution continues . sudan s powerful intelligence chief stepped down on saturday, two days after the president was ousted, as huge crowds of demonstrators remained encamped outside the country s military headquarters. those demonstrators, who in the past week have numbered in the hundreds of thousands, have proved the most potent force for democratic change to sweep through sudan in more than three decades. in response to their demands over the past week, sudan s armed forces deposed president omar hassan al bashir, the autocrat who had ruled the country since 1989. that was midday thursday. but the junta that took power and announced that it intended to rule for the next two years quickly discovered that the demonstrators weren t going home. by friday night, the general who appeared to be in charge of the junta announced that he was stepping down. the move was seen as intended to assuage the demonstrators, who viewed him as not very different from the ousted president a point their protest chant made clear: we do not replace a thief with a thief. and saturday, the state news agency announced the resignation of the intelligence chief, salah abdallah gosh, a notorious and feared figure in sudan s security establishment who was widely considered the second most powerful figure after mr. al bashir. in a sense, mr. gosh s departure was another victory for the protesters, many of whom have been calling for his agency, the national intelligence and security service, to be dismantled. but it was not clear whether the protesters anger at the intelligence service had led to mr. gosh s resignation, or whether rival security chiefs and military generals in sudan s fractured security establishment had ousted him in a power struggle. demonstrators cheered into the night at the toppling of a second reviled bashir regime leader in less than 48 hours. their numbers swelled on the seventh night of demonstrations in front of the army headquarters in the capital, khartoum, and in defiance of a curfew. protest leaders hailed the announcement that the general was stepping down as a victory of people s will . we now want to witness the power being handed over to the civilians, this is the ... democracy and freedom we aimed to achieve, abdul jabar ibrahim, 60, said. general ibn auf, whose deputy, kamal abdel marouf al mahi, also quit, named his successor as abdel fattah abdelrahman burhan, a general but a less islamist figurehead and one the military hopes will be accepted. he was expected to address the nation today. sara abdelgalil, from the sudanese professionals association, the main protest group, hailed the resignations as two great victories , and said that the momentum of the revolution should be augmented . demonstrators near sudan s military headquarters in khartoum on sunday, april 14. sudan s new ruling military council announced on sunday that it would name a civilian prime minister and cabinet, but not a president, to help govern the country after the coup that removed the longtime leader omar hassan al bashir. an army spokesman, lt. gen. shamseldin kibashi, also said in televised remarks that the military had begun to overhaul security organizations and would allow demonstrations to continue outside the military headquarters in khartoum, the capital. the announcement was unlikely to satisfy protesters, though, who have demanded full civilian rule. organizers have urged the military to immediately and unconditionally hand power to a transitional civilian government. the sudanese professionals association, which has spearheaded the protests, posted a nine point list of demands on sunday, including prosecution of those behind an islamist backed military coup in 1989, a freeze on the assets of leading officials in mr. al bashir s government and dismissal of top judges and prosecutors. the sit in that began more than a week ago has spawned a mini state in sudan s capital, run entirely by young sudanese men and women working as equals for a single cause. the movement started four months ago in anger over bread prices and came to a climax last week when it toppled president bashir, the despot who had ruled for 30 years. within hours his immediate interim successor had also been ousted. in a microcosm of our society, committees have been set up to deliver every service that demonstrators might need. for medical care, there is a free clinic, pharmacy and blood donor trucks. a steady supply of food and water arrives from volunteers homes in sudan hospitality is everything. temporary barber shops have sprung up, cleaners work in shifts round the clock and tea ladies hand out free www.drinks.no one even need worry about missing the football after a donor sent in a huge screen. last week rows of fans cheered the champions league match between barcelona and manchester united. the protest site is the only fully functioning area of khartoum since the mass sit in began on april 6. the leaders of sudan s uprising have threatened to escalate protests that toppled omar al bashir unless the council of generals that took power in his place is disbanded and replaced by civilian rulers. protesters piled on the pressure with a long list of demands after successfully blocking a fresh attempt to break up their mass sit in outside the defence ministry in the capital, khartoum, which began ten days ago and proved the tipping point that ended bashir s 30 years of brutal rule. speaking for the first time since the removal of bashir, 75, last thursday, representatives of the sudanese professionals association spa said they would not co operate with the ruling council unless their demands were met. we will continue the mass escalation and the sit ins to fulfil our demands, said ahmed al rabie, from the spa. the latest concession from the military ruling council, for protesters to name their preferred interim prime minister and cabinet, was insufficient while bashir era appointees had power, protest leaders said. tens of thousands of youthful protesters remain camped outside the military s headquarters, refusing to leave until the military grants their demand for a swift transition to civilian rule. until now, the sit in has been an exuberant, peaceful affair, drawing vast crowds of young sudanese who sing, dance, deliver speeches and flirt, visibly relieved that mr. al bashir s gloomy, repressive rule is over. but talks about the country s future between the military and the protest leaders, led by the sudan professionals association, collapsed this weekend, and tensions are rising. on sunday night, april 21st, tens of thousands of people gathered for one of the largest demonstrations yet, holding their cellphones aloft to create a sea of pinpoint lights. protesters sat over the edge of a railway bridge, banging stones in unison to emphasize their chants. some decried lt. gen. abdel fattah al burhan, the country s interim leader, as filthy. on monday, april 22nd, general al burhan called on the protesters to abandon the checkpoints that ring the sit in area, where volunteers in yellow vests politely search protesters for weapons. security, he noted pointedly, is the military s responsibility. amid the chants praising the revolution of the people, a new slogan appeared this week at a massive sit in protest in sudan s capital: we do not want saudi aid even if we have to eat beans and falafel! the chant underscored the suspicion in the protest camp about the motives of saudi arabia and its close ally, the united arab emirates, after they jointly pledged 3 billion in aid to sudan s transitional military government, which deposed sudanese president omar hassan al bashir this month after 30 years in power. many within the protests fear that the powerful monarchies in saudi arabia and the uae are using their immense wealth to suppress democracy and support a counterrevolution, as they have been accused of doing elsewhere in the region. talks between sudan s protesters, led by the sudanese professionals association, and the military, resumed on wednesday, april 24 after stalling briefly. bankers and senior judges have joined the sit in, strengthening the hand of the protesters. thousands are still camped out at the gates of sudan s military headquarters, demanding a transition to full civilian rule. outside the military headquarters in khartoum, where thousands are demanding a swift transition to civilian rule, darfuris stand defiantly at the gates of the military that persecuted them for years. some hold banners with graphic photos that depict the atrocities they say were visited on their community: piled corpses, torched villages, rape victims sitting mutely. thousands of protesters demanding an immediate transition to civilian rule have been camped at the gates of the military headquarters since mr. al bashir, who ruled sudan for 30 years, was toppled on april 11. generals and protest leaders in sudan have met to try and agree a final deal that would bring an end to decades of brutal military rule. the generals who ousted president bashir last month appeared close to bowing to international demands to make way for civilian rule and prevent a descent into bloodshed and political chaos. the two sides have agreed on transitional structures that will lead sudan to elections in three years, but the thorniest issue of who will hold overall power is still to be settled. demonstrators have sworn to maintain a mass sit in that has gridlocked the streets of the capital, khartoum, for weeks unless the generals agree that civilians should be given the majority of seats on a new sovereign ruling council. crucial negotiations were due to begin may 15th. general yasser al atta, from the ruling council, said: we vow to our people that the agreement will be completed fully within 24 hours in a way that it meets the people s aspirations. on tuesday may 21st, protest leaders called for a general strike after talks with military leaders on a proposed transitional government collapsed. divisions are appearing both within the protest camp and the military leadership, and the feeling of hope that blossomed after bashir s ouster has given way to frustration, a sign that sudan s revolutionary honeymoon may be coming to an end. sudan s security forces stormed a major protest camp in the nation s capital of khartoum on monday, june 3rd, killing an estimated 31 people and wounding hundreds, protest organizers said, in a day of violence that plunged the country s once hopeful revolution into chaos and uncertainty. the dawn raids, led by a paramilitary unit notorious for atrocities in the western region of darfur, appeared to signal that the military was intent on breaking the pro democracy movement that galvanized sudan following the ouster in april of the longtime dictator and president omar hassan al bashir. soldiers fanned out across the city from first light, opening fire on protesters, burning their tents and thrashing civilians with sticks. the brutal crackdown came days after the collapse of power sharing negotiations between civilian and military leaders over who should run sudan during a planned transitional period. on monday that transition was cast into doubt as sudan lurched toward the kind of bloody authoritarianism that quashed the arab spring in 2011. the crackdown confirmed protesters fears that sudan s military, backed by the wealthy rulers of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, was never serious about its claims to support civilian rule. a day after security forces violently cleared the main protest camp in khartoum, the leaders of sudan s protest movement rejected a plan by the nation s military leaders to hold elections within nine months. the paramilitary group, known as the rapid support forces, or rsf, patrolled khartoum s streets, putting the city on lockdown and setting up dozens of checkpoints. the rsf dismantled the sit in site monday in an attack that killed at least 35, according to sudan doctors syndicate, a professional group associated with the protests. in a statement, the group said that four of the dead were children and that 650 people had been injured. note: the variation in state

2 tens of thousands of angry iraqis took to the streets to demand changes to their government friday in a potent challenge to prime minister haidar al abadi from his own shiite constituency, including the country s powerful militias. chanting crowds thronged baghdad s central tahrir square and jammed the main streets around it, some calling on abadi to fire corrupt ministers and others urging more sweeping changes to the system of governance installed after the u.s. invasion of 2003. the protest was the largest in a surge of demonstrations across the country over the past week. iraqis are enduring an unusually intense heat wave, and the government has proved unable to provide basic services 12 years after the invasion left the country s infrastructure smashed. the numbers in and around tahrir square far exceeded a much smaller demonstration a week ago organized by secular activist groups to protest the lack of electricity when temperatures are routinely hitting 120 degrees or more. friday s demonstration, in contrast, had the backing of the country s powerful shiite factions, whose militias are leading the fight against the islamic state and who have increasingly been agitating for greater political power. it also had the support of the highly influential religious leader grand ayatollah ali sistani, regarded as the voice of shiite moderation...in a statement issued in response, abadi vowed to heed the demands being voiced by protesters. i promise to announce a comprehensive reform plan, he said. similarly large protests were held across the shiite south, including in the cities of basra, najaf, karbala and nasiriyah. the demonstrations underscored the building challenge to abadi, who was appointed a year ago at the urging of the united states to bring new energy to the fight against the islamic state. but he has struggled to wield his authority with a government widely perceived as corrupt and ineffective, while the power of the non state militias has further eroded his ability to act. some of the demonstrators called directly for abadi s resignation...though all the demonstrators complained about corruption and the lack of services, there were noticeable differences in their demands, reflecting rifts emerging among iraqi shiites as the fight against the islamic state unfolds. supporters of qais al khazali, who heads the powerful iranian backed asaib ahl al haq militia, echoed his demand for the abolition of iraq s elected parliament and its replacement with a presidential system. if you think you can carry out reforms, we are with you, khazali said in a televised statement late friday night. if you think you can t, resign. the protesters included a sizable number of supporters of former prime minister nouri al maliki, who suppressed similar demonstrations against the corruption of his government four years ago by detaining and intimidating organizers. ...iraqi protesters shout slogans and carry iraqi flags during a demonstration at tahrir square in central baghdad on aug. 7. thousands of protesters took to the streets in the different provinces of iraq, fueled by anger over electricity shortages and demanding better services, economic reforms and the end of corruption. ;
