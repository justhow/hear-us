the women continue their protest despite the cold and the attacks by hindu nationalist activists. a group of women in delhi occupied a large road in protest and have remained there. the sit in where women had gathered to protest a new citizenship law was gone, the posters torn and trampled. the mosque next door stood charred and silent, its floor smeared with blood. stillness filled a major road, empty except for stray dogs picking their way through debris. a tense calm settled on a swath of india s capital wednesday, february 26 after a stunning outbreak of communal violence this week left 27 dead. the riots are the worst such clashes to hit delhi in decades and came as president trump made his first official visit to india. mobs of hindus and muslims had clashed on roads and alleyways in northeast delhi, throwing stones and crude gasoline bombs. at least three mosques were torched, as were scores of homes and businesses. witnesses said that instead of stopping the violence, police joined crowds shouting hindu nationalist slogans and fired indiscriminately. the riots in delhi took place against a backdrop of rising tensions over a controversial citizenship law passed by the modi government in december. critics say the measure is unconstitutional and has stoked fears that muslims will be treated like second class citizens in modi s india. protests against the law have erupted nationwide, with indians of all religions taking part. but muslims have led the opposition to the law. meanwhile, members of modi s ruling bharatiya janata party have vilified the protesters, calling them traitors who deserve to be shot and linking them with india s rival pakistan. one such leader, kapil mishra, helped trigger this week s violence: he threatened to clear a sit in conducted by muslim women, sparking a clash between supporters and opponents of the citizenship law.the way the police responded to the violence in delhi points to a troubling conclusion, said ashutosh varshney, a political scientist at brown university who has researched communal clashes in india. the cops either looked away or participated, he said. that means there was state connivance and state culpability it s a pogrom, varshney said. m.s. randhawa, a spokesman for the delhi police, told reporters wednesday that sufficient force was deployed in the northeastern part of the city, and additional paramilitary personnel were brought in to assist. the situation is under control, he said.thousands of extra riot police were sent to the capital yesterday, with orders to shoot rioters on sight. last night they appeared to have imposed an uneasy calm, but the damage was done. many of delhi s two million muslims, about 11 per cent of the city s population, have seen enough. note: the actual start date of the protest event is not provided in the sources, and is based on prior coding decisions. note: the state responses are coded to reflect the government s different responses over the life of the protest event reports indicate that the government ignored the protests until february 26th, at which point they engaged in shootings and crowd dispersal.",ignore,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

confrontation with the pakistani government over official attempts to amend a law that requires all political candidates to affirm their belief that muhammad, who lived in the 7th century, was islam s final prophet. more than 95 percent of pakistanis are muslim. the demonstrators were stopped by security forces and shipping containers placed across major roads, halting most traffic in the capital region for much of the day and preventing office workers, students and other commuters from traveling between islamabad and the nearby garrison city of rawalpindi. they remained there as night fell and vowed to stay indefinitely. the crusade to defend the honor of the prophet is being led by a fringe muslim group called the movement in service of the messenger of god. it is widely seen as an attempt to arouse public antipathy to ahmadis, a small religious minority in pakistan whose followers claim to be muslim but who also follow a 19th century prophet. ahmadis were declared non muslim in 1974. the emotional protests, which began two weeks ago and have grown since, are also viewed as a direct challenge to the authority of the federal government, which has been weakened since former prime minister nawaz sharif was ousted by the supreme court. the messenger of god movement, once seen as a purely religious fringe group, has begun running candidates for parliament in the past two months. the protest leaders have demanded that the federal law minister be fired, charging that he was behind an effort to weaken the electoral law affirming the prophet s finality. they declared saturday that they will not leave their protest site at the main entrance to the capital until the minister is punished. pakistani media reports said they also threatened to attack the homes of some government officials. thousands of supporters of a firebrand pakistani cleric, many armed with sticks and iron rods, have blocked a main entrance to islamabad since last week, demanding the resignation of the country s law minister and a strict adherence to blasphemy laws. led by khadim hussain rizvi of the tehreek e labaik pakistan party, at least 3,000 protesters were staging a sit in on one of the main highways leading to the capital. officials say they suspect some of the protesters are carrying more serious weapons, and there is concern the standoff might turn violent. in response, the government has blocked several other roads to stop the protesters from moving to important government buildings. the latest controversy erupted last month, when the government introduced changes to electoral laws. a change in the wording of an oath for lawmakers that dealt with a declaration of prophet muhammad as god s final prophet quickly set off a furor among opposition parties, especially the religious groups. they protested that the change amounted to blasphemy. thousands of pakistani police officers in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets on saturday as they tried to clear out supporters of a firebrand cleric who have paralyzed the pakistani capital for weeks with a protest on a main highway. authorities said at least six protesters were killed and 200 people including dozens of police officers and paramilitary troops were injured as stone throwing crowds fought with police for control of a highway intersection. clashes also broke out in other cities, including lahore and karachi, with officials saying at least 150 protesters have been arrested. as plumes of smoke rose from the site of the highway clashes, officials in islamabad requested the help of the army to control the law and order situation in the capital, according the ministry of interior. the ministry said that the military authorities would determine the number of troops to be deployed. the demonstrations began three weeks ago after the release of a proposed new version of an oath to be taken by lawmakers that omitted mention of the prophet muhammad. the protesters, many of them supporters of the cleric, khadim hussain rizvi, an outspoken islamist, have demanded that the law minister resign for the omission, which they called blasphemy. supporters of mr. rizvi s political party, tehreek e labaik pakistan, have been camped at the faizabad interchange, blocking the main road from the capital, islamabad, to neighboring rawalpindi. they refused to clear the road until the government agreed to remove the law minister, zahid hamid, over the changed oath. as the standoff has escalated, protest leaders have stepped up their demands, and are now calling for the entire cabinet to resign. protests by muslim activists continued for a second day across pakistan on sunday, but most were peaceful and security forces kept a distance from the crowds, averting a repeat of the unrest that gripped cities and towns saturday after police stormed a protest camp blocking a highway to the capital. pakistan s government struck a deal on monday with leaders of a fundamentalist islamist protest movement, saying that the country s law minister would step down in return for an end to demonstrations that had brought violent clashes and paralyzed the pakistani
